**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** The API is going to be shut down and `urcli` will become inactive in the following months. You should no longer use `urcli` alongside any official Udacity mentor dashboard features. The only command that is currently recommended is `notify`. You can read about `notify` in the following section:

## The `notify` Command

While the reviews developer team works on implementing all of the functionality in the dashboard I've added a new command that let's `urcli` show Desktop notifications when submissions are assigned:

```
urcli notify
```

This command only hits the `/me/assigned` endpoint, so it doesn't touch the submission request or interact with the queue in any way. That being said, Udacity has been clear in saying that it doesn't support 3rd party tools anymore, so this new feature will not be supported by anyone. It's one of those take-it-or-leave-it things :smile:. There is no one to complain to if it breaks your computer. With that also being said, it really should be safe to use it while we wait for an official notification feature.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v6.0.0 or higher
- NPM (v3.0.0+ recommended) (this comes with Node.js)

## :zap: Quickstart

1. Run `npm install -g urcli`.
2. Get a new token from the API Access link in the [Reviewer Dashboard](https://review.udacity.com/#!/submissions/dashboard). <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QH7onbk.png" alt="Token retrieval" width="500px">
3. Run `urcli setup`. When prompted, paste in the token you just got and then go through the rest of the setup.
4. Run `urcli assign` proceeded by valid project ids for projects you are certified for. Ex:
    - `urcli assign 145`, places you in the queue for project 145.
    - `urcli assign 134 145 46`, places you in the queues for project 145, 134 and 46.
    - `urcli assign all`, places you in the queue for every project you are certified for.
5. Profit! (literally).

## Upgrade

2. Get a new token (See Quickstart #2).
1. Press `ESC` to stop the currently running instance (If you have urcli running).
3. Run `npm i -g urcli`.
4. Run `urcli setup`.
5. Run your assign command, `urcli assign all`.
